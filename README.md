# pluralsight-using-hooks-in-react

There is no difference between the code in the module titled:

Handle Forms Better with useActionState and useFormStatus

for clips 1 and 2. Clip 1 is the intro and shows a simple html file that can be found:

/SimpleSignupForm.html

Clip 2 is the same code but put the same form functionality in a React component and that can be found in:

../components/home/SignupForm.js
